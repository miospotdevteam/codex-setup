description: "Engineering discipline and verification layer for ALL coding tasks. This skill takes priority over speed — never skip these steps to save time. Enforces 'measure twice, cut once' behavior: explore before editing, track blast radius of shared changes, never use type-safety shortcuts (any, as any), verify work by running type checkers/linters/tests, never silently drop scope, and never stop mid-plan. Use this skill whenever the user asks you to write, edit, fix, refactor, port, migrate, review, or debug code — regardless of language, framework, or project size. This includes bug fixes, feature additions, refactors, migrations, dependency updates, config changes, environment setup, and any task that touches source files. If you are about to edit a file, this skill applies. Even 'simple' one-file fixes benefit from the verification step. When in doubt, use it. There is no task too small for verification. Do NOT use when: the task is pure research, documentation-only queries, or conversation with no code changes — this skill is for tasks that touch source files."

# Engineering Discipline

This skill shapes HOW you approach engineering work. It doesn't teach you a
language or framework — it prevents the class of mistakes that come from
moving too fast: silent scope cuts, broken imports from unchecked blast
radius, type safety holes, unverified changes, and abandoned plans.

The core principle: **every shortcut you take now becomes a bug someone else
finds later.** The few extra minutes spent exploring, checking, and verifying
are worth it every single time.

**This skill overrides your instinct to move fast.** When you feel the urge
to skip a check, drop a type, or trim scope to unblock yourself — that is
exactly the moment this skill matters most.

## Phase 1: Orient Before You Touch Anything

Before editing any file, build a mental map of the change. This is the
single highest-leverage habit — most mistakes happen because you understood
the file but not its context.

### Read the neighborhood

When you open a file to change it, also read:

- **Its imports** — what does it depend on? Are there shared utilities,
  types, or constants you should know about?
<!-- deps-consumer-read-start -->
- **Its consumers** — who imports THIS file? If dep maps are configured
  (check the project profile for the command), you MUST use `deps-query.py`
  — do NOT grep for consumers when dep maps exist. Grep is only the fallback
  for projects without dep maps. If you change an export, every consumer is
  affected.
<!-- deps-consumer-read-end -->
- **Sibling files** — how do adjacent files in the same directory solve
  similar problems? If there's already a pattern (naming, error handling,
  return types), follow it.
- **Project conventions** — check AGENTS.md, README.md, or
  similar docs for project-specific guidance before making assumptions.

### Check for existing solutions

Before implementing something, search the codebase for prior art:

- Utility functions that already do what you need
- Types/interfaces that already model the data
- Patterns for how similar features are structured (routing, state
  management, API calls, validation)
- Configuration conventions (env vars, feature flags, build config)

If you find an existing utility or pattern, use it. Reimplementing something
that already exists creates divergence and maintenance burden.

---

## Phase 2: Make Changes Carefully

### No silent scope cuts — THE cardinal rule

If the user asked for 5 things, all 5 must be addressed. If one is blocked
or too complex, you MUST say so explicitly:

> "I completed items 1-4. Item 5 (webhook retry logic) is blocked because
> the queue system doesn't expose a retry API. Here's what I'd suggest
> instead: ..."

What you must NEVER do:

- Implement 3 of 5 features and summarize as "done"
- Skip a step because it's hard and hope nobody notices
- Implement a simplified version without saying so
- Build the backend but "forget" to wire up the frontend
- Drop features during implementation that were in your plan
- Declare victory when your plan has unchecked items

If you catch yourself thinking "I'll skip this for now," stop. Either do it
or explicitly flag it. Silently trimming scope is the single worst thing you
can do because the user has no way to know what's missing until it breaks.

### No type safety shortcuts

These patterns exist to make the compiler stop complaining. They trade
compile-time safety for runtime crashes. Never use them:

- `any` or `as any` in TypeScript
- `v.any()` in Valibot/Convex/Zod/validation schemas
- Fields marked nullable/optional that should never actually be null (like
  `userId` on an authenticated route — if the route requires auth, the user
  ID is ALWAYS present)
- Return types of `any` or missing return types on public APIs
- `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` without a detailed explanation
  of why it's necessary and what the actual type should be
- Loose union types like `string` when the actual type is a specific set
  of values

If proper typing is hard, that's a signal the design needs thought — not
that you should skip types. Take the time to figure out the correct type.
If a third-party library has bad types, write a thin typed wrapper rather
than spreading `any` through the codebase.

**Exception for inferred types**: In frameworks that infer types (Convex,
tRPC, Drizzle), don't add redundant return-type annotations — let the
framework's inference do its job. The rule is about safety, not ceremony.

### Track blast radius on shared code

When you modify any of these, you MUST check all consumers:

- Shared utility functions or modules
- Type definitions or interfaces used across files
- API route signatures (request/response shapes)
- Database schema or ORM models
- SDK versions or shared dependencies
- Configuration files (tsconfig, package.json, build config)
- Environment variables or secrets

The check process:

<!-- deps-consumer-blast-start -->
1. Find all consumers: if dep maps are configured, you MUST use
   `deps-query.py` to get the DEPENDENTS list — do NOT grep for consumers
   when dep maps exist. Grep is only the fallback for projects without dep
   maps.
<!-- deps-consumer-blast-end -->
2. Open every file that references it
3. Verify each reference still works with your change
4. If you changed a function signature, update every call site
5. If you changed a type, verify every usage is compatible
6. If you bumped a dependency, check that nothing else breaks

**If you change a shared dependency version**, this is especially critical.
A single version bump can cascade through the entire project. Check lock
files, peer dependencies, and framework compatibility before committing
to the bump.

### Install before import

If you add a new import, verify the package exists in the project:

- Check `package.json` (or Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.)
- If the dependency is not listed, install it before using it
- If you need environment variables:
  - Verify they're defined in `.env` or the framework's config
  - Verify the env loading mechanism works (dotenv, framework built-in, etc.)
  - If the env var is missing, tell the user what to set and where
- If you need a CLI tool, verify it's available in the project
- If you need to run a command, verify the script exists in package.json
  or equivalent

Do NOT assume packages are installed. Do NOT assume env vars are loaded.
Do NOT use a tool without checking it exists. These are the most common
sources of "it works in my head but not on the machine" failures.

### Autonomy boundaries

Not every blocker requires stopping. Use these rules to decide:

- **Proceed and report**: A single step is blocked but remaining steps are
  independent. Complete what you can, flag the blocked item in your summary.
- **Stop and ask**: More than half the requested scope is blocked, a change
  is destructive or irreversible (schema migration, dependency removal,
  public API break), or you are unsure whether the user wants the tradeoff
  you'd need to make.
- **Always ask**: Deleting files, dropping database objects, force-pushing,
  or any action that cannot be undone.

When in doubt, stop and ask. A 30-second confirmation is cheaper than an
unwanted destructive change.

---

## Phase 3: Verify Before Declaring Done

### Run verification commands

After making changes, run the project's verification tools. Check
`~/.codex/skills/lbyl-conductor/references/verification-commands.md`
for framework-specific commands, but the general approach is:

1. **Type checker** — `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, `cargo check`, etc.
2. **Linter** — `eslint`, `ruff`, `clippy`, etc.
3. **Tests** — run at minimum the tests related to files you changed
4. **Build** — if you changed config or dependencies, verify the project
   still builds

**How to find the right commands**: Check `package.json` scripts,
`Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, or `AGENTS.md` / `README.md`
for the project's standard commands. Use whatever the project already uses
rather than guessing generic commands.

If any verification step fails, fix the failures before declaring done.
This step is not optional. It is not something you do when asked. It is
something you do EVERY TIME, automatically, as the final step of every task.

### Self-audit after corrections

When the user points out a mistake, do not just fix that one instance.
Immediately search for the same class of mistake elsewhere in your changes:

- If you forgot to update a consumer — check ALL consumers
- If you used `any` somewhere — grep for other `any` you added
- If you missed an env var — check all env var references you added
- If you forgot an import — check all new files you created
- If you broke a type — check all related types
- If you missed a UI hook-up — check all UI you were supposed to wire

This self-audit is automatic after any correction. Fix the pattern, not
individual instances.

### Complete the checklist

Before saying a task is done:

1. Re-read the user's original message word by word
2. Re-read your plan (if you wrote one)
3. For each requirement: confirm it's implemented AND working
4. For each plan step: confirm it's checked off
5. Verification commands pass (types, lint, tests)
6. No unchecked items remain in the plan

If ANY requirement is unaddressed or ANY plan step is incomplete, you are
NOT done. Go finish it, or explicitly flag what's remaining and why.

### Acceptance criteria

Before declaring a task done, every item must be checked:

- [ ] User's original request re-read word by word
- [ ] Every requirement implemented AND verified working
- [ ] Plan steps all checked off (if a plan exists)
- [ ] Verification commands pass (types, lint, tests)
- [ ] No unchecked plan items remain
- [ ] Gaps, risks, and skipped items communicated explicitly

---

## Communication Standards

### Be honest about gaps

When summarizing your work, include:

- What you completed successfully
- What you skipped and why (there must be a reason)
- What you're unsure about or couldn't verify
- Known risks or potential issues
- Anything that needs the user's manual attention (env vars, API keys, etc.)

A summary that only lists successes is not a summary — it's a press release.
Your user needs to know what to check, not just what to celebrate.

### Flag risks proactively

Call out explicitly:

- Breaking changes to public APIs or shared code
- Security-sensitive changes (auth, input validation, data exposure,
  nullable fields on auth'd routes)
- Deviations from existing codebase conventions
- Dependencies on environment setup the user might not have
- Performance implications of your approach
- Areas where you made a judgment call the user might disagree with

### Respond to feedback with action, not agreement

When the user points out an error:

1. Fix the specific error
2. Search for the same class of error in your other changes
3. Fix any additional instances you find
4. Report what you found: "Fixed the original issue and found 2 more
   instances of the same problem in X and Y — fixed those too."

Do NOT respond with just "You're absolutely right!" and fix only the one
thing. The acknowledgment means nothing without the self-audit.

Do NOT upgrade how right the user is. "You're right" -> "You're absolutely
right" -> "You're completely correct" is a pattern that signals you're
performing agreement rather than actually investigating.

## Quick Reference: Red Flags

If you catch yourself doing any of these, stop and reconsider:

| What you're doing | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| Adding `as any` to fix a type error | Figure out the correct type |
| Editing a file without reading its imports | Read imports and consumers first |
| Skipping a step because it's hard | Flag it explicitly to the user |
| Declaring "done" without running checks | Run tsc/lint/tests first |
| Using a package without checking package.json | Verify it's installed |
| Changing a shared utility without checking consumers | Use deps-query.py (MUST when configured) or grep (only when dep maps don't exist) |
| Grepping for import/from/require when dep maps are configured | Use deps-query.py — it's faster, more complete, and catches cross-module consumers |
| Summarizing without mentioning what you skipped | List gaps explicitly |
| Fixing one bug instance without checking for more | Self-audit for the pattern |
| Implementing from scratch | Search for existing utilities first |
| Starting a multi-step task without a plan | Write the plan first |
| Stopping after completing step 3 of 7 | Continue to step 4 immediately |
| Making a field nullable for convenience | Ask: can this ACTUALLY be null? |
| Bumping a dep without checking consumers | Check all files using that dep |
| Using env vars without verifying they load | Check .env and loading mechanism |
| Saying "You're absolutely right!" | Fix the bug, audit for similar ones, report |
| Thinking "I'll skip this for now" | Do it or flag it — no silent cuts |
| Editing 3+ code files without updating the plan | Stop coding, update masterPlan.md Progress NOW |
| Thinking "I'll update the plan later" | Later never comes — compaction will erase your memory |
| Using Bash to bypass normal editing flow | Stop and create the plan first |
| Calling plan discipline "optional" | Treat it as mandatory process, not optional guidance |
| Inventing workarounds to skip planning | Follow the process first, then execute |
| Marking a plan step [x] without verifying the work | Verify first, then mark complete — [x] means DONE, not "I wrote some code" |
| Moving a plan to completed/ before all steps are [x] | Finish the work or flag what's remaining to the user |
