description: "Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior. Enforces root cause investigation before fixes. Four phases: investigate, analyze patterns, form hypotheses, implement. Prevents guess-and-check thrashing. Use ESPECIALLY when under pressure or when 'just one quick fix' seems obvious. Do NOT use for: learning unfamiliar APIs (use exploration), performance optimization without a specific regression, or code review without a reported bug."

# Systematic Debugging

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask root causes.

**Core principle:** Find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes
are failure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

**Always** — for any technical issue: test failures, bugs, unexpected
behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Especially** when:
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- You don't fully understand the issue

## Boundaries & Safety

**Must not:**
- Commit debug instrumentation (temporary logs, print statements). Remove
  all before declaring done.
- Make destructive changes to reproduce a bug without user confirmation
  (dropping data, deleting files, resetting state, truncating tables).
- Modify shared infrastructure, production config, or environment files
  as part of debugging without user confirmation.
- Scope-creep fixes beyond the root cause — no "while I'm here" cleanup.

**User confirmation required before:**
- Attempting a 4th fix (existing rule in Phase 4.5 — elevated here)
- Adding persistent instrumentation (logging that stays in production code)
- Modifying database schema, environment config, or CI pipelines to debug
- Reverting commits or resetting branches

**Agent may proceed autonomously:**
- Adding and removing temporary debug logging within a single session
- Reading any file, running any read-only diagnostic command
- Running existing tests, build commands, type checkers
- Making the single fix that addresses the confirmed root cause

---

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

### 1. Read error messages completely

Don't skip past errors or warnings. Read stack traces top to bottom.
Note file paths, line numbers, error codes. Error messages often contain
the exact solution.

### 2. Reproduce consistently

- Can you trigger it reliably?
- What are the exact steps?
- Does it happen every time?
- If not reproducible, gather more data — don't guess

### 3. Check recent changes

- `git diff` and `git log` — what changed?
- New dependencies, config changes, environment differences?
- Use `git bisect` for regression hunting:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad              # current commit is broken
git bisect good <commit>    # last known good commit
# git runs binary search — test each commit it offers
git bisect good/bad         # repeat until it finds the culprit
git bisect reset            # done
```

### 4. Use a debugger when appropriate

Before adding print statements everywhere, consider whether a debugger
would be faster:
- Set breakpoints at the error site and step backward through the call stack
- Watch variable values change through execution
- Inspect closure scope, `this` binding, prototype chains
- Most editors and runtimes have built-in debugger support

Use print/log debugging when: CI failures, distributed systems, timing-
sensitive bugs where pausing changes behavior.

### 5. Gather evidence in multi-component systems

When the system has multiple layers (API → service → database, CI → build
→ deploy), add diagnostic instrumentation at each boundary BEFORE
proposing fixes:

```
For EACH component boundary:
  - Log what data enters the component
  - Log what data exits the component
  - Verify environment/config propagation

Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks.
Then investigate that specific component.
```

### 6. Trace data flow to the source

When the error is deep in the call stack, trace backward. Don't fix where
the error appears — find where the bad value originates.

See `references/debugging-root-cause-tracing.md` for the full backward
tracing technique.

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

### 1. Find working examples

Locate similar working code in the same codebase. What works that's
similar to what's broken?

### 2. Compare against references

If implementing a pattern, read the reference implementation COMPLETELY.
Don't skim — read every line. Partial understanding guarantees bugs.

### 3. Identify differences

What's different between working and broken? List every difference,
however small. Don't assume "that can't matter."

### 4. Understand dependencies

What other components does this need? What settings, config, environment?
What assumptions does it make?

If dep maps are configured (check the project profile), run `deps-query.py`
on the buggy file to see its full dependency chain and all consumers. This
reveals: which modules feed data into the buggy code (potential upstream
causes), and which consumers are affected (blast radius of the bug and fix).
If dep maps are not configured and this is a TypeScript project, suggest
configuring dep maps before broad debugging work — it makes dependency tracing instant.

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

### 1. Form a single hypothesis

State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y." Be specific, not
vague. Write it down.

### 2. Test minimally

Make the SMALLEST possible change to test the hypothesis. One variable at
a time. Don't fix multiple things at once.

### 3. Evaluate and iterate

- Hypothesis confirmed? → Phase 4
- Hypothesis wrong? → Form a NEW hypothesis based on what you learned
- Don't stack fixes on top of failed attempts

### 4. When you don't know

Say "I don't understand X." Don't pretend. Research more, ask for help,
or add more instrumentation.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

### 1. Create a failing test

Write the simplest possible test that reproduces the bug. Use the Red
phase from `lbyl-test-driven-development` to write a
failing test that captures the bug.

A test proves the bug exists, proves the fix works, and prevents
regression. Never fix bugs without a test.

### 2. Implement a single fix

Address the root cause — not the symptom. ONE change at a time. No
"while I'm here" improvements.

### 3. Verify

- Test passes?
- Other tests still pass?
- No new warnings or errors?

### 4. Add defense-in-depth

After fixing the root cause, add validation at multiple layers to make
the bug structurally impossible to recur.

See `references/debugging-defense-in-depth.md` for the multi-layer
validation pattern.

### 5. If the fix doesn't work

- Count: how many fixes have you tried?
- If < 3: return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
- **If 3+: STOP and question the architecture**

Three failed fixes is a pattern. It means the problem isn't a bug — it's
a design issue. Each fix revealing new problems in different places is
the signature of an architectural mismatch.

Discuss with the user before attempting more fixes. This is not a failed
hypothesis — this is a wrong architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria

Before declaring a debugging task done, ALL must be true:

- [ ] Root cause identified and documented (not just "it works now")
- [ ] Failing test written that reproduces the original bug
- [ ] Fix addresses root cause, not symptom
- [ ] All existing tests pass (including the new regression test)
- [ ] No debug instrumentation left in code
- [ ] Defense-in-depth validation added where appropriate
- [ ] No unrelated changes introduced

## Red Flags — STOP and Return to Phase 1

| What you're thinking | What to do |
|---|---|
| "Quick fix for now, investigate later" | Investigate now — "later" never comes |
| "Just try changing X and see" | Form a hypothesis first |
| "Add multiple changes, run tests" | One change at a time |
| "It's probably X, let me fix that" | Probably ≠ confirmed. Investigate. |
| "I don't fully understand but this might work" | Understand first |
| "Here are the fixes: [list]" without investigation | You're guessing. Phase 1 first. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | Question the architecture |
| Each fix reveals problems in a different place | Architectural issue, not a bug |
