description: "Use after discovery to write implementation plans with TDD-granularity steps. Produces masterPlan.md that assumes the implementing engineer has zero codebase context and questionable taste. Every masterPlan step is one component/feature; TDD rhythm (test, verify fail, implement, verify pass, commit) lives in its Progress items. Consumes discovery.md from exploration phase. Invoke explicitly at Step 2 of the conductor. Do NOT use when: the user explicitly says 'just do it' or 'no plan', resuming an existing plan (use persistent-plans resumption protocol), executing a plan that already exists on disk, or doing pure research/exploration without code changes."

# Writing Plans

Turn discovery findings into bite-sized implementation plans. Assume the
implementing engineer has zero context for this codebase and questionable
taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, complete code,
exact commands, expected output. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized
tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the
implementation plan."

**Prerequisite:** Discovery must be complete. If no `discovery.md` exists
in the plan directory, go back to Step 1 (Explore) first.

---

## The Steps

### 1. Read the discovery

Read `discovery.md` from `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/`. Understand
the scope, entry points, consumers, existing patterns, test infrastructure,
and blast radius. This feeds directly into the masterPlan.

If dep maps are configured, the discovery MUST include `deps-query.py` output
for every file in scope. This output powers accurate blast-radius analysis in
the plan — without it, consumer counts and cross-module impacts are guesses.
If the discovery lacks deps-query output for a TypeScript project, go back to
Step 1 (Explore) and run it before planning.

If the brainstorming skill produced a `design.md` in the same plan
directory (`.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/design.md`), read that
too — it contains the approved design decisions.

### 2. Identify applicable disciplines

Scan the task and mark which checklists apply. Read each relevant checklist
now — they inform how you structure the steps.

| If the task involves... | Read before planning... |
|---|---|
| Writing or modifying tests | `references/testing-checklist.md` |
| Building or modifying UI | `references/frontend-design-checklist.md` + `references/ui-consistency-checklist.md` |
| Auth, input validation, secrets | `references/security-checklist.md` |
| Adding/removing packages | `references/dependency-checklist.md` |
| API route handlers or endpoints | `references/api-contracts-checklist.md` |

Also note these for the executing engineer (they apply during execution,
not planning):

- **git-checklist.md** — applies at every commit step
- **linting-checklist.md** — applies after any code changes

### 3. Write the masterPlan

Use the template from `references/master-plan-format.md`. Write to
`.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/masterPlan.md`.

The Discovery Summary in the masterPlan comes directly from your
discovery.md findings.

#### Plan document header

Every masterPlan MUST include this directive after the title so that a
fresh session knows how to execute it:

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

> **For Codex:** REQUIRED SKILL: Use lbyl-engineering-discipline
> for all steps. Also invoke each step's `Skill` field when it is not `none`.
> See the Required Skills section for the full list.
```

#### Granularity: how steps map to TDD

One masterPlan Step = one component or feature unit. The TDD rhythm lives
in the **Progress** checklist within each step:

```markdown
### Step N: <Component Name>
- **Status**: [ ] pending
- **Skill**: `lbyl-test-driven-development` | none
- **Simplify**: true/false
- **Files involved**: `src/auth/validator.ts`, `tests/auth/validator.test.ts`
- **Description**: Add email validation to the auth module.
- **Acceptance criteria**: `npm test -- validator` passes, tsc clean.
- **Progress**:
  - [ ] Write failing test
  - [ ] Run test — verify it fails
  - [ ] Implement minimal code to pass
  - [ ] Run tests — verify they pass
  - [ ] Commit
- **Result**:
```

Each Progress item is one action (2-5 minutes).

#### When to set `Simplify: true`

Set `Simplify: true` on a step when any of these apply:

- Step modifies **3 or more files**
- Step creates **new abstractions** (utilities, components, modules)
- Step involves **structural changes** (refactored APIs, new patterns)
- User **explicitly requests** simplification for the step

Default to `false` for simple steps (1-2 files, straightforward changes).
When in doubt, leave it `false` — the user can always request a
simplification pass manually.

#### Key rules

- **Exact skill identifiers** — in Required Skills AND in each step's
  `Skill` field, use the full skill name (e.g., `lbyl-frontend-design`),
  never vague hints like "look for skills about testing". Post-compaction
  Codex has no memory — only exact names let it invoke the right skill.
  Use `none` for steps that don't need a specialized skill.
- **Complete code in every step** — not "add validation" but the actual
  code the engineer should write
- **Exact file paths** — every step lists Create/Modify/Test files
- **Exact commands with expected outcome** — include the command to run and
  the expected outcome (pass/fail, exit code, key output lines), not
  necessarily full verbatim output
- **Self-contained** — the masterPlan is the ONLY thing the executing
  engineer reads. If it's not in the plan, it doesn't exist for them
- **DRY / YAGNI** — cut anything not clearly needed right now
- **Frequent commits** — after every green test or logical unit of work

#### Concrete example

### Step 1: Email validation utility

- **Status**: [ ] pending
- **Skill**: none
- **Simplify**: false
- **Files involved**:
  - Create: `src/lib/validate-email.ts`
  - Create: `tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts`
- **Description**: Add an email validation function. Rejects empty strings,
  missing @, missing domain. Returns `{ valid: boolean; error?: string }`.
- **Acceptance criteria**: `npx vitest run validate-email` passes, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Progress**:
  - [ ] Write failing test
  - [ ] Run: `npx vitest run validate-email` — expect FAIL (module not found)
  - [ ] Implement minimal code
  - [ ] Run: `npx vitest run validate-email` — expect PASS
  - [ ] Commit: `git add src/lib/validate-email.ts tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts && git commit -m "feat: add email validation utility"`

**Test code:**
```typescript
import { validateEmail } from '../src/lib/validate-email'

test('rejects empty string', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('')).toEqual({ valid: false, error: 'Email is required' })
})

test('rejects missing @', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('foo')).toEqual({ valid: false, error: 'Invalid email format' })
})

test('accepts valid email', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('user@example.com')).toEqual({ valid: true })
})
```

**Implementation code:**
```typescript
export function validateEmail(email: string): { valid: boolean; error?: string } {
  if (!email) return { valid: false, error: 'Email is required' }
  if (!email.includes('@') || !email.split('@')[1]?.includes('.')) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid email format' }
  }
  return { valid: true }
}
```
````

### 4. Hand off to execution

After saving the masterPlan to disk:

1. Read the masterPlan back from disk.
2. Summarize the plan to the user with the key steps, files involved, and
   acceptance criteria.
3. Proceed unless the user explicitly asks to revise the plan first.

The masterPlan is still the source of truth. During execution, follow
`lbyl-persistent-plans` and update the plan on disk every 2-3 file edits.

---

## Boundaries

This skill must NOT:

- **Create plans outside `.temp/plan-mode/`** — all plans live in the
  defined directory structure, nowhere else.
- **Modify discovery.md during planning** — discovery is read-only input.
  If you find gaps, go back to Step 1 (Explore) first.
- **Overwrite an existing masterPlan.md without user consent** — if a plan
  already exists in the target directory, ask before replacing it.
- **Hide a non-trivial plan from the user** — summarize the plan before
  execution unless they explicitly said to skip plan review.
- **Write implementation code** — this skill produces plans, not code files.
  Code belongs in the plan's code blocks, not in the project source tree.

**Autonomy limits**: reading discovery, reading checklists, writing
masterPlan.md, and writing sub-plans are autonomous. Overwriting an existing
plan requires user confirmation.

**Prerequisites**: this skill is always invoked via `lbyl-conductor` at
Step 2. Discovery must be complete (`discovery.md` must exist in the plan
directory).

## Principles

- **Zero-context, questionable taste** — spell everything out; don't trust
  the engineer to make good test design or naming decisions
- **One component per step** — TDD rhythm in Progress items, not separate steps
- **TDD by default** — test first, then implement, always
- **Complete code** — never write "add error handling", write the actual code
- **DRY / YAGNI** — only what's needed now, nothing speculative
