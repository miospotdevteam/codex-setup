description: "Use after discovery to write implementation plans with TDD-granularity steps. Produces both plan.json (execution source of truth) and masterPlan.md (user-facing proposal for Orbit review). Every step is one component/feature; TDD rhythm (test, verify fail, implement, verify pass, commit) lives in its progress items. Consumes discovery.md from exploration phase. Invoke explicitly at Step 2 of the conductor. Do NOT use when: the user explicitly says 'just do it' or 'no plan', resuming an existing plan (use persistent-plans resumption protocol), executing a plan that already exists on disk, or doing pure research/exploration without code changes."

# Writing Plans

Turn discovery findings into bite-sized implementation plans. Assume the
implementing engineer has zero context for this codebase and questionable
taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, precise
descriptions with file paths, exact commands, expected output. Give them
the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the
implementation plan."

**Prerequisite:** Discovery must be complete. If no `discovery.md` exists
in the plan directory, go back to Step 1 (Explore) first.

---

## The Steps

### 1. Read the discovery

Read `discovery.md` from `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/`. This is the
raw exploration log — an append-only markdown file written during Step 1.

**Discovery flow** (each written once, never updated during execution):
1. **`discovery.md`** — raw exploration log (may have duplicates, rough notes)
2. **`plan.json.discovery`** — structured extraction: the 8 discovery fields
   distilled from the raw log into clean, self-contained summaries
3. **`masterPlan.md` Discovery Summary** — human-readable rendering of the
   same findings for Orbit review

Read discovery.md and extract what you need into plan.json's `discovery`
object. masterPlan.md's Discovery Summary is a human rendering of the same
data — both are written once during planning, then frozen.

If dep maps are configured, the discovery MUST include `deps-query.py` output
for every file in scope. If the discovery lacks deps-query output for a
TypeScript project, go back to Step 1 (Explore) and run it before planning.

**design.md**: If the brainstorming skill produced a `design.md` in the same
plan directory, read it — it contains approved design decisions that must
inform the plan. Reference specific design decisions in step descriptions
where relevant (e.g., "Per design.md: use composition over inheritance for
the validator chain").

### 2. Identify applicable disciplines

Scan the task and mark which checklists apply. Read each relevant checklist
now — they inform how you structure the steps.

| If the task involves... | Read before planning... |
|---|---|
| Writing or modifying tests | `references/testing-checklist.md` |
| Building or modifying UI | `references/frontend-design-checklist.md` + `references/ui-consistency-checklist.md` |
| Auth, input validation, secrets | `references/security-checklist.md` |
| Adding/removing packages | `references/dependency-checklist.md` |
| API route handlers or endpoints | `references/api-contracts-checklist.md` |

Also note these for the executing engineer (they apply during execution,
not planning):

- **git-checklist.md** — applies at every commit step
- **linting-checklist.md** — applies after any code changes

### 3. Write the plan (dual output)

Produce **both** files in `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/`:

#### plan.json — execution source of truth

Use the schema from `references/plan-schema.md`. This file is what Codex
reads and updates during execution. Include:

- All discovery findings in the `discovery` object
- Steps with TDD-granularity progress items
- Inline sub-plans for large steps (see Step 4 below)
- Exact skill identifiers in `skill` fields

#### masterPlan.md — user-facing proposal (write-once)

This is the document the user reviews via Orbit. It communicates **intent**,
not execution state. **It is frozen after Orbit approval** — never updated
during execution. All runtime state lives in plan.json.

Use the template from `references/master-plan-format.md`. No `[x]`/`[ ]`
checkboxes. No execution state. Just what, why, and what could go wrong.

#### Step granularity: how steps map to TDD

One plan.json step = one component or feature unit. The TDD rhythm lives
in the **progress** array within each step.

**The key insight: each step must have MULTIPLE red-green cycles.** Don't
write all tests at once — that's speculative testing, not TDD. Instead,
break the behavior into slices and iterate: simplest case first, then add
complexity one behavior at a time. Each cycle adds 1-3 tests for one
specific behavior, then implements just enough to pass.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Email validation utility",
  "status": "pending",
  "skill": "lbyl-test-driven-development",
  "simplify": false,
  "files": ["src/lib/validate-email.ts", "tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts"],
  "description": "Add email validation function. Rejects empty strings, missing @, missing domain.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": "npx vitest run validate-email passes, tsc --noEmit clean.",
  "progress": [
    {"task": "Cycle 1 RED: test for simplest valid email", "status": "pending", "files": ["tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts"]},
    {"task": "Cycle 1 GREEN: implement basic validation", "status": "pending", "files": ["src/lib/validate-email.ts"]},
    {"task": "Cycle 2 RED: tests for empty string and missing @", "status": "pending", "files": ["tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts"]},
    {"task": "Cycle 2 GREEN: add rejection logic", "status": "pending", "files": ["src/lib/validate-email.ts"]},
    {"task": "Cycle 3 RED: tests for missing domain and edge cases", "status": "pending", "files": ["tests/lib/validate-email.test.ts"]},
    {"task": "Cycle 3 GREEN: handle remaining cases", "status": "pending", "files": ["src/lib/validate-email.ts"]},
    {"task": "Refactor and final verification", "status": "pending"}
  ],
  "subPlan": null,
  "result": null
}
```

Each progress item is one action (2-5 minutes). Notice the pattern:
alternating RED/GREEN items, each covering a slice of behavior. The
simplest case comes first. Aim for **3-5 cycles per step** — enough to
prove incrementalism without being tedious.

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** A single "Write all tests" item followed by a
single "Implement everything" item. That's test-first waterfall, not TDD.
The whole point of TDD is that each cycle's implementation informs what
the next cycle should test.

#### When to set `simplify: true`

Set `simplify: true` on a step when any of these apply:

- Step modifies **3 or more files**
- Step creates **new abstractions** (utilities, components, modules)
- Step involves **structural changes** (refactored APIs, new patterns)
- User **explicitly requests** simplification for the step

Default to `false` for simple steps.

#### Key rules

- **Exact skill identifiers** — in each step's `skill` field, use the full
  skill name (e.g., `lbyl-frontend-design`), never vague
  hints. Post-compaction Codex has no memory — only exact names work.
  Use `"none"` for steps that don't need a specialized skill.
- **Precise descriptions with file paths** — not vague "add validation" but
  specific what-to-do with exact file paths and acceptance criteria. Plans
  describe *what* to build; the executing engineer writes the code.
- **Exact file paths** — every step lists files in the `files` array
- **Exact commands with expected outcome** — in description or acceptance
  criteria, include the command and expected result
- **Self-contained** — the plan.json is the ONLY thing the executing
  engineer reads. If it's not in the plan, it doesn't exist for them
- **DRY / YAGNI** — cut anything not clearly needed right now
- **Frequent commits** — after every green test or logical unit of work

### 4. Evaluate sub-plan needs (mandatory checkpoint)

**Before saving the plan, evaluate EVERY step against these criteria:**

For each step, count the files in its `files` array. If ANY of these are
true, the step MUST have an inline `subPlan` with groups:

1. **More than 10 files** in the `files` array
2. **Repetitive sweep** — the description contains words like "all", "every",
   "sweep", "migrate all", "across the codebase"
3. **More than 5 progress items** that are independently completable
4. **More than 8 files to read** just to understand what to change
5. **The step is a migration** that touches the same pattern in many files

If ANY criterion is met, restructure the step NOW:

```json
{
  "subPlan": {
    "groups": [
      {"name": "Dashboard pages", "files": ["a.tsx", "b.tsx", "c.tsx"], "status": "pending", "notes": null},
      {"name": "Modal components", "files": ["d.tsx", "e.tsx"], "status": "pending", "notes": null}
    ]
  }
}
```

Groups should have 3-8 files each. If a group exceeds 8, split it.

**This is a hard checkpoint.** Do not proceed to Step 5 until every step
has been evaluated. If you skip this, large steps will fail mid-execution
when context runs out.

### 5. Present for review via Orbit

After saving both files to disk, present masterPlan.md to the user for
interactive review using the Orbit MCP:

1. Tell the user: *"The plan is open in VS Code for review. Add inline
   comments on any section, then click Approve or Request Changes."*
2. If the Orbit MCP is available, call `orbit_await_review` with the
   masterPlan.md path. This generates
   the artifact, opens it in VS Code, and **blocks** until the user clicks
   Approve or Request Changes.

If Orbit MCP tools are unavailable or fail unexpectedly, stop and surface
the setup issue instead of silently skipping review.

#### Handle the response

`orbit_await_review` returns JSON with `status` and `threads`.

- **`approved`, no threads** → proceed to step 6.
- **`approved`, with threads** → read each thread, reply with
  `orbit_reply` acknowledging the feedback, resolve threads, then proceed
  to step 6.
- **`changes_requested`** → read all threads. Update both masterPlan.md
  and plan.json to address the feedback. Reply to each thread explaining
  what changed. Resolve threads. Call `orbit_await_review` again for
  re-review. Loop back to handle the new response.
- **`timeout`** → tell the user the review timed out and ask them to
  review when ready.

### 6. Summarize and proceed (post-approval)

After the plan is approved via Orbit:

1. Read the plan.json and masterPlan.md you just wrote from disk.
2. Summarize the approved plan to the user with the key steps, files
   involved, and acceptance criteria.
3. Proceed into execution unless the user explicitly asks for more plan
   revisions or says to stop after planning.

## Boundaries

This skill must NOT:

- **Create plans outside `.temp/plan-mode/`** — all plans live in the
  defined directory structure, nowhere else.
- **Modify discovery.md during planning** — discovery is read-only input.
  If you find gaps, go back to Step 1 (Explore) first.
- **Overwrite an existing plan without user consent** — if a plan already
  exists in the target directory, ask before replacing it.
- **Skip the Orbit review** — every plan must be presented to the user
  for review via Orbit MCP before execution.
- **Pretend `masterPlan.md` is the runtime tracker** — execution state
  belongs in `plan.json`, not in the Orbit-reviewed proposal.
- **Write implementation code** — this skill produces plans, not code files.
- **Skip the sub-plan evaluation** — Step 4 is mandatory for every plan.

**Autonomy limits**: reading discovery, reading checklists, writing plan
files, and writing sub-plans are autonomous. Overwriting an existing plan
and skipping Orbit review for a non-trivial plan require user confirmation.

**Prerequisites**: this skill is always invoked via `lbyl-conductor` at
Step 2. Discovery must be complete (`discovery.md` must exist in the plan
directory).

## Principles

- **Zero-context, questionable taste** — spell everything out; don't trust
  the engineer to make good test design or naming decisions
- **One component per step** — TDD rhythm in progress items, not separate steps
- **TDD by default** — test first, then implement, always
- **Precise descriptions** — never write vague "add error handling"; specify
  exactly what to do, which files, and how to verify. Plans describe intent;
  the executing engineer writes the code.
- **masterPlan.md is write-once** — frozen after Orbit approval. All runtime
  state lives in plan.json
- **DRY / YAGNI** — only what's needed now, nothing speculative
- **Sub-plans are mandatory** — if a step meets the criteria, it gets one
