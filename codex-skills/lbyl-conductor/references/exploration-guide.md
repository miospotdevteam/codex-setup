# Exploration Guide

Deep guidance for thorough codebase exploration. Read this when the
exploration-protocol.md checklist isn't enough — when you need techniques
for complex or unfamiliar codebases.

## Why Exploration Matters

The #1 cause of plan failures is shallow exploration. You read one file,
assume you understand the system, then discover halfway through implementation
that:

- A shared utility already does what you're building
- The naming convention is different from what you assumed
- There are 15 consumers you didn't check
- The test framework has helpers you didn't use
- The project has patterns you violated

**Every minute exploring saves five minutes fixing.**

## Scope Discovery Techniques

### Start wide, then narrow

1. **Directory scan**: `ls` the relevant directories to see the full picture
2. **File count**: How many files in the scope area? This tells you plan sizing
3. **Grep for keywords**: Search for terms from the user's request
4. **Read the neighborhood**: For each file you'll modify, read its directory siblings

### Trace the dependency graph

For every file you plan to modify:

```
File you're changing
  ├── What it imports (upstream dependencies)
  ├── What imports it (downstream consumers)
  └── What it shares with siblings (common patterns)
```

**If dep maps are configured**: You MUST use `deps-query.py` to trace both
directions. It returns DEPENDENCIES and DEPENDENTS across all modules
instantly — including transitive cross-module consumers that grep would miss.
Do NOT fall back to grep for consumer analysis when dep maps exist.

**If dep maps are NOT configured**: Use `Grep` to trace both directions.
Don't stop at the first level — if you're changing a utility that's imported
by a component that's imported by a page, you need to know about the page
too.

### Using dependency maps (MANDATORY when configured)

If dep maps are configured (the conductor skill's "Minimum exploration
actions" section has the resolved command), you MUST use `deps-query.py`
instead of manual grep for consumer analysis. This is not a suggestion —
dep maps are the primary and required method for finding consumers in
configured projects. Use the exact command shown in the conductor skill.

This returns both DEPENDENCIES (what the file imports) and DEPENDENTS
(what imports it) across all configured modules — including cross-module
consumers (e.g., `packages/shared` imported by `apps/api`).

The maps auto-regenerate when stale (files edited since last generation).
See `references/dependency-mapping.md` for full details.

**When to use grep instead**: ONLY for non-TypeScript files, for string
references (config keys, env vars), or when dep maps are not configured.
Never grep for import/from/require patterns on TypeScript files when dep
maps exist — that is exactly what deps-query.py does, but better.

### Check for feature flags and configuration

Before building a feature, check if the project uses:

- Feature flags (LaunchDarkly, env-based, config files)
- A/B testing frameworks
- Environment-specific behavior
- Build-time vs runtime configuration

These constraints change implementation approach significantly.

## Shallow vs Thorough Exploration

### Shallow (causes failures)

- Read only the file you're about to edit
- Assume naming conventions without checking
- Skip searching for existing utilities
- Don't count consumers
- Don't read tests
- Don't check AGENTS.md or README

### Thorough (prevents failures)

- Read the file AND its imports AND its consumers
- Search for existing solutions before implementing
- Count consumers of any shared code you'll modify
- Read at least one test file to understand patterns
- Read project docs for conventions
- Check for configuration that affects your work
- Verify packages you need are actually installed

## Anti-patterns

### "I'll figure it out as I go"

This leads to mid-implementation discoveries that force plan rewrites.
Explore first — it's faster overall.

### "This file is self-explanatory"

No file exists in isolation. Its imports, consumers, and sibling patterns
all constrain how you should modify it.

### "The user said it's simple"

Even simple changes can have wide blast radius. A one-line type change
can break 20 consumers. Always check.

### "I've seen this pattern before"

Every codebase has its own conventions. What worked in the last project
may violate patterns in this one. Verify, don't assume.

## When Exploration Reveals Problems

If during exploration you discover:

- **The task is larger than expected**: Tell the user before planning. "I
  found 45 consumers of this utility. This is bigger than a quick fix."
- **A better approach exists**: Suggest it. "The codebase already has a
  similar utility at src/lib/format.ts. Should we extend that instead?"
- **Blockers exist**: Flag them. "The API endpoint this depends on doesn't
  exist yet. Should I create it or is that a separate task?"
- **Requirements are ambiguous**: Ask. Don't guess and build the wrong thing.

## Confidence Calibration

| Confidence | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | Missing answers to 2+ protocol questions | Keep exploring |
| **Medium** | All questions answered but some based on inference | Proceed, flag unknowns |
| **High** | All questions answered with concrete evidence | Proceed with confidence |

If you're at Low confidence after 10 minutes of exploration, tell the user
what's blocking you rather than guessing.
