# look-before-you-leap

A Claude Code plugin that makes Claude behave like a disciplined engineer instead of a fast-but-sloppy one.

## The Problem

Claude is fast and pleasant to work with. It's also unreliable for serious engineering work. These failure modes aren't edge cases — they happen constantly:

| What Claude does | What actually happens |
|---|---|
| Silently drops scope | You ask for 5 things, get 3 done, and it declares victory |
| Doesn't check blast radius | Changes a shared utility and breaks every consumer |
| Leaves type safety holes | `as any`, nullable fields that should never be null, `v.any()` in schemas |
| Never verifies its own work | Doesn't run tsc, linter, or tests after changes |
| Doesn't explore the codebase | Fixes a file in isolation without checking patterns or conventions |
| Skips operational basics | Uses packages without installing them, reads env vars without checking they're loaded |
| Loses track after compaction | Forgets the plan, stops mid-task, or restarts work already done |
| Glazes instead of self-auditing | "You're absolutely right!" then fixes only the one thing you pointed out |

## How It Works

### Three-layer architecture

Context is expensive. Not every task needs every rule. The plugin loads knowledge progressively:

**Layer 1: The Conductor** (always in context, ~250 lines)
The main SKILL.md that controls the process. Enforces: explore before editing, write a plan before coding, checkpoint progress, verify before declaring done. Routes to deeper layers when needed.

**Layer 2: Discipline Checklists** (~30-50 lines each, loaded during planning)
Quick-reference checklists for testing, UI consistency, security, git, linting, dependencies, and API contracts. Read the relevant checklist before starting that kind of work.

**Layer 3: Deep Guides** (~80-150 lines each, loaded on demand)
Comprehensive strategies for testing (TDD-lite, test theater detection), UI consistency (design tokens, drift detection), and security (OWASP Top 10, slopsquatting prevention).

### Persistent plans

Every task gets a plan written to `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/masterPlan.md` before any code is edited. Plans have numbered steps with progress checklists that get updated every 2-3 file edits. When context compacts, the plan survives on disk — Claude reads it and picks up exactly where it left off.

### Enforcement hooks

The plugin doesn't just give instructions — it enforces them:

| Event | Hook | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **SessionStart** | `session-start.sh` | Injects all three skill layers, detects active plans, discovers other installed plugins, auto-detects project stack |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | `onboarding.sh` | First-run setup: walks user through config enrichment, CLAUDE.md creation, and plugin suggestions |
| **PreToolUse** (Edit\|Write) | `enforce-plan.sh` | Blocks code edits if no active plan exists |
| **PreToolUse** (Edit\|Write) | `check-api-contracts.sh` | Warns when editing API boundary files |
| **PreToolUse** (Bash) | `enforce-plan-bash.sh` | Blocks Bash file-write bypasses (redirects, sed -i, tee) without an active plan |
| **PreToolUse** (Bash) | `guard-plan-completion.sh` | Blocks moving a plan to completed/ if it has unchecked steps |
| **PreToolUse** (Task) | `inject-subagent-context.sh` | Injects discipline rules into every sub-agent, creates shared discovery file for cross-agent findings |
| **PostToolUse** (Edit\|Write) | `remind-plan-update.sh` | Reminds to checkpoint the plan after 3 code edits without a plan update |
| **PostToolUse** (Edit\|Write) | `auto-complete-plan.sh` | Detects when all plan steps are complete and prompts finalization |
| **Stop** | `verify-plan-on-stop.sh` | Blocks stopping if the active plan has unfinished steps |

### First-run onboarding

When you open a project for the first time with this plugin installed, it:

1. Auto-detects your stack (language, frameworks, package manager, monorepo structure)
2. Creates `.claude/look-before-you-leap.local.md` with the detected config
3. On your first message, walks you through setup:
   - Shows what was detected
   - Offers to enrich the config by exploring the codebase
   - Offers to create a `CLAUDE.md` if the project doesn't have one
   - Suggests useful official Anthropic plugins and offers to install them

This only happens once per project. The config file is never overwritten after creation.

### Project config

The auto-generated `.claude/look-before-you-leap.local.md` contains YAML frontmatter with your detected stack. Hooks use this to adapt behavior — for example, `check-api-contracts.sh` only fires if your stack includes a backend framework.

To customize, edit the file directly. Add it to `.gitignore` if you don't want it committed.

## Origin Story

This plugin was built iteratively through real-world testing on production codebases. Each rule exists because Claude actually made that specific mistake. The sub-plan triggers, checkpoint frequency, auto-compaction survival logic, and discipline checklists were all calibrated based on actual failures during real tasks.
