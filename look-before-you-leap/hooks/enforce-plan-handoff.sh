# PostToolUse hook: Enforce plan review handoff for fresh plans.
#
# After every Edit/Write to a masterPlan.md, checks if the plan is fresh
# (all steps are [ ], none are [x] or [~]). If so:
# 1. Creates .handoff-pending marker inside the plan directory
# 2. Injects directive to present the plan via Orbit MCP for user review
#
# The Orbit flow: generate resolved artifact (opens in VS Code) → user
# reviews with inline comments → user approves or requests changes →
# Claude reads feedback, iterates if needed, then proceeds to execution
# via plan mode handoff (EnterPlanMode → summarize → ExitPlanMode).
#
# The marker is cleared by session-start.sh (new session = context cleared).
# Bypass: ask the user to run /bypass
