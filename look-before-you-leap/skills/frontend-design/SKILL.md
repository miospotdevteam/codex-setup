name: frontend-design
description: "Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces. Detects greenfield vs integration mode, uses a 6-axis decision matrix for aesthetic direction, provides framework-specific implementation guidance, and verifies quality through accessibility, responsive, performance, and coherence checklists. Use when building or designing web components, pages, or applications. Do NOT use when: fixing a CSS bug with no design change, brainstorming without implementation intent (use brainstorming instead), or making backend-only changes. When brainstorming preceded this skill, skip Phases 1-2 and start at Phase 3."

# Frontend Design

Build frontend interfaces that are distinctive, intentional, and
production-grade. This skill replaces vague "be creative" advice with a
structured process that produces consistently high-quality results while
preventing the generic aesthetic convergence that plagues AI-generated UIs.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the frontend-design skill to guide the
design and implementation."

---

## Prerequisites

This skill operates within the conductor's Step 1-3:

- **Phase 1** (Context Scan) runs during Step 1 (Explore) and feeds
  `discovery.md`.
- **Phase 2** (Design Direction) runs between Step 1 and Step 2 — its
  outputs are consumed by `writing-plans` when creating the masterPlan.
- **Phases 3-4** (Implementation, Verification) run during Step 3 (Execute).

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**After brainstorming:** If `brainstorming` ran first and produced a
`design.md` with visual direction (typography, colors, layout choices):
**skip Phases 1-2 entirely**. Use the approved design and proceed to
Phase 3.

**After immersive-frontend request:** If `immersive-frontend` invoked
this skill for design direction only, run Phase 2 (Design Direction) and
return the approved choices. Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 — immersive-frontend
handles implementation.

**Standalone:** If neither preceded this skill, run the full flow
(Phases 1-4) with the user approval checkpoint in Phase 2.

**Design already decided:** If the user's request is purely "build this
mockup/design" (design already decided): skip Phase 2, proceed to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 1: Context Scan

Determine the operating mode before making any design decisions.

### Detect the mode

**Greenfield mode** — you have full creative freedom:
- Building a standalone page, component, or prototype
- No `tailwind.config` custom theme, no CSS variables, no component library,
  no theme files
- User explicitly says "from scratch" or "new design"

**Integration mode** — you work within an existing system:
- Project has Tailwind config with custom theme, CSS variables, or a
  component library
- Existing pages/components establish clear patterns
- User is adding to or modifying an existing UI

### Greenfield scan

Note these before proceeding:
- **Framework**: vanilla HTML/CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, etc.
- **Constraints**: must work without JS? SSR-compatible? Performance budget?
- **Delivery format**: single HTML file? Component library? Full app?
- **Audience and purpose**: who uses this and why?

### Integration scan

Read these before proceeding:
- `tailwind.config` / CSS variables / theme files — extract the token system
- 2-3 existing pages/components — learn the visual language
- Component library docs (Shadcn, MUI, Chakra, etc.) — know what's available
- Note what's working well and what could be elevated

In integration mode, also read:
- `references/ui-consistency-checklist.md` — consistency rules
- `references/ui-consistency-guide.md` — design token discipline

**Both modes:** Write findings to `discovery.md` as part of the conductor's
Step 1 exploration.

**Failure path:** If the project has no discernible design system and isn't
greenfield (e.g., inconsistent styles, no tokens), treat it as greenfield
with the constraint of matching existing code conventions.

---

## Phase 2: Design Direction

### Greenfield — Decision Matrix

Score each axis on a 1-5 scale based on the project context. The combination
narrows the aesthetic space before any visual decisions are made.

| Axis | 1 | 5 |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | Technical / developer | General public / consumer |
| **Formality** | Corporate / institutional | Casual / personal |
| **Energy** | Calm / restrained | Dynamic / energetic |
| **Density** | Spacious / minimal | Dense / information-rich |
| **Era** | Classic / timeless | Contemporary / trendy |
| **Temperature** | Warm (organic, rounded) | Cool (geometric, precise) |

**Example:** A developer documentation site — Technical (5), Formal (3),
Calm (4), Dense (4), Contemporary (4), Cool (5) — narrows to:
monospace-influenced typography, cool neutral palette with one accent, generous
line-height but compact layout, subtle animations, geometric shapes.

**Example:** A children's educational app — General (5), Casual (5),
Energetic (5), Spacious (2), Contemporary (4), Warm (5) — narrows to:
rounded display font, bright primary palette, generous whitespace, bouncy
animations, organic shapes.

#### Creative seed protocol

After scoring the axes, pick ONE unexpected element to anchor the design.
This prevents convergence — it's the memorable thing that makes this design
THIS design, not a generic template.

Good creative seeds:
- An unusual color as the primary (not blue, not purple)
- A distinctive display font that sets the tone
- An unconventional layout technique (asymmetric grid, overlapping elements)
- A signature animation moment (page load choreography, scroll reveal)
- A textural element (noise, grain, mesh gradient, pattern)

Bad creative seeds (overused, will produce generic results):
- Purple-to-blue gradient on white
- Card grid with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Fade-in-up animations on scroll
- Inter or Space Grotesk as the display font

#### Concrete choices

With the axes scored and creative seed chosen, select:

1. **Typography**: Display font + body font (consult
   `references/frontend-design-guide.md` for sourcing)
2. **Color**: Primary + secondary + accent + neutrals (specific values).
   **Prefer a pre-built palette library** when possible (see
   `references/frontend-design-guide.md` § Pre-built Palette Libraries):
   - **Radix Colors** — best for dark mode, 12-step functional scales
   - **Open Color** — simple, balanced, good for quick starts
   - **Palx** — expand a brand hex into a full-spectrum palette
   If generating manually, use HSL shift, OKLCH, or complementary methods
   (see § Palette Generation Methods). State which source/method you used.
3. **Motion**: Animation philosophy + key moments (load, hover, transitions)
4. **Layout**: Grid system, spacing scale, composition approach
5. **Texture**: Backgrounds, borders, shadows, depth treatment

**Present all choices to the user before proceeding.** Walk through the axis
scores, creative seed, and concrete selections. Do NOT proceed to Phase 3
until the user approves the direction. If the user disagrees, iterate on
the specific choices they reject.

Document all approved choices in the masterPlan before writing code.

#### Motion tier assessment

Based on the Energy axis score and the user's vision, classify the motion
needs:

| Tier | Signals | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | Energy 1-3, CSS transitions, hover states, simple page transitions | This skill (Phase 3) |
| **Enhanced** | Energy 3-4, scroll-driven reveals, parallax, text choreography, GSAP-level animation | `immersive-frontend` (Motion-Enhanced tier) |
| **Immersive** | Energy 5, WebGL, 3D scenes, custom shaders, canvas experiences, Awwwards-style | `immersive-frontend` (WebGL-Lite or Full Immersive tier) |

If the motion tier is **Enhanced** or **Immersive**: this skill's job ends
after the user approves the design direction. Write the handoff document
to `discovery.md` or `design.md` using this structure, then invoke
`immersive-frontend`:

```markdown
## Design Handoff → immersive-frontend
- **Axis scores**: [all 6 scores]
- **Creative seed**: [description]
- **Typography**: [display + body fonts, weights, scale]
- **Color system**: [primary, secondary, accent, neutrals with hex/oklch]
- **Dark mode**: [yes/no, if yes: adaptation notes]
- **Animation philosophy**: [key moments, easing, duration scale]
- **Motion tier**: [Enhanced / Immersive]
- **Scope**: [full-page / hybrid section — if hybrid, which sections]
```

`immersive-frontend` will consume this and handle technical architecture
and implementation.

#### Hybrid project scope partition

For projects with both standard UI and immersive sections, this skill and
`immersive-frontend` split ownership:

| Aspect | `frontend-design` owns | `immersive-frontend` owns |
|---|---|---|
| Design direction | All design decisions (both skills) | — |
| Standard UI pages | Implementation + verification | — |
| Immersive sections | — | Implementation + verification |
| Shared design tokens | Defines tokens | Consumes tokens |
| Transition zones | Provides CSS for entering/exiting | Provides canvas setup |

If the motion tier is **Standard**: proceed to Phase 3 in this skill.

#### Failure paths

- If the chosen font is unavailable or has insufficient weights, select
  the next alternative from the same category in the guide.
- If the creative seed produces poor results during implementation, revisit
  it — pick a new seed and adjust the concrete choices before continuing.

### Integration — Design System Extension

When working within an existing system, creativity operates WITHIN the
constraints:

1. **Audit the existing system** — identify its strongest and weakest aspects
2. **Propose 1-2 elevation opportunities** — better animation, more
   intentional spacing, refined typography within the existing type scale
3. **Stay within the token system** — extend it only if the user approves
4. **Match existing patterns** — loading states, error states, component
   structure

The goal is not to redesign the system but to raise the quality bar for the
new work within its vocabulary.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Anti-slop philosophy

Every design decision must be intentional. These patterns signal generic,
unconsidered output — avoid them:

| Category | Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| Fonts | Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui as display | Satoshi, General Sans, DM Sans, Outfit, Manrope |
| Colors | Purple-to-blue gradient on white | Start from Temperature axis; use OKLCH palette from brand color |
| Colors | Pure black on pure white (#000/#fff) | Near-black on near-white (`#1a1a2e` / `#fafaf9`) |
| Layout | Symmetric 3-card grid with identical shadows | Bento, masonry, asymmetric splits, varied card sizes |
| Animation | Fade-in-up on every scroll section | Animate 2-3 key moments; leave the rest static |
| Patterns | Glassmorphism with no purpose | Solid surfaces with texture (grain, noise) or accent borders |

The full blacklist is in `references/frontend-design-guide.md` § Anti-Slop
Blacklist.

### Vanilla HTML/CSS

- CSS custom properties for all design tokens
- CSS-only animations (`@keyframes`, `transition`)
- Google Fonts with `font-display: swap` and system font fallbacks
- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- Responsive with CSS Grid/Flexbox and `clamp()` for fluid typography

### React

- CSS modules or styled-components (match project convention)
- Motion library (framer-motion / motion) for orchestrated animations
- Component composition — small, focused components over monoliths
- Font loading with `next/font` (Next.js) or `@fontsource` (other React)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query respected in all animations

### Tailwind projects

- Extend `tailwind.config` for custom tokens — don't fight the system
- Custom plugin for unique design tokens when the config is insufficient
- Arbitrary values (`text-[17px]`) only when no token exists
- `@apply` sparingly — prefer utility classes in markup
- Use the project's existing spacing/color patterns; introduce new values
  only with justification

### Font sourcing

Consult `references/frontend-design-guide.md` for the full font sourcing
protocol. Quick reference:

| Source | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| Google Fonts | Default for web | `<link>` tag, `font-display: swap` |
| `@fontsource` | React/Next.js | `npm install @fontsource/font-name` |
| `next/font` | Next.js | Built-in optimization, auto subset |
| Variable fonts | When available | Single file, `font-variation-settings` |
| System fonts | Fallbacks only | Font stack with system-ui |

### Dark mode

When the design supports dark and light themes:

1. **Semantic tokens, not raw values.** Define `--surface`, `--on-surface`,
   `--muted`, `--border`, `--ring` etc. as CSS variables. Toggle them via a
   class (`.dark`) or `prefers-color-scheme`.
2. **Dark ≠ inverted.** Don't flip every color. Dark backgrounds need:
   - Near-black with a warm or cool tint (`#0f0f12`, not `#000`)
   - Reduced text contrast — `#e0e0e0` on dark, not pure white
   - Lowered shadow opacity (shadows are less visible on dark surfaces)
   - Borders and dividers become lighter/more subtle, not darker
3. **Elevation via lightness.** In dark mode, higher surfaces are *lighter*
   (opposite of light mode where elevation = shadow). Use 2-3 surface tiers:
   `--surface-0` (darkest), `--surface-1`, `--surface-2` (lightest).
4. **Primary color adaptation.** Saturated primaries that work on white may
   need desaturation or lightness adjustment for dark backgrounds. Test
   contrast at both themes.
5. **Tailwind**: use the `dark:` variant with `darkMode: 'class'` in config.
   **Vanilla CSS**: use `[data-theme="dark"]` or `.dark` class on `<html>`.

See `references/frontend-design-guide.md` § Dark Mode Color Adaptation for
the full adaptation rules.

### Micro-interactions

Purposeful micro-interactions make interfaces feel alive. Add them to the
moments that matter, not everywhere.

| Interaction | Pattern | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Hover lift** | `transform: translateY(-2px)` + shadow increase | 200ms ease-out |
| **Button press** | `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active` | 100ms ease-in |
| **Focus ring** | `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--ring)` on `:focus-visible` | instant (no transition on focus) |
| **Toggle switch** | Thumb slides with `transform: translateX()` + bg color transition | 200ms ease |
| **Dropdown open** | `transform: scaleY(0→1)` from `transform-origin: top` + `opacity` | 150ms ease-out |
| **Card hover** | Border color shift or subtle glow, not just shadow lift | 200ms ease |
| **Link underline** | Width grows from left via `background-size` or `clip-path` | 250ms ease-out |

Rules:
- Use `transition` for user-triggered interactions, `@keyframes` for
  entrance choreography
- Always pair visual feedback with `:focus-visible` for keyboard users
- All micro-interactions must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (disable or
  simplify)
- Consistent easing — pick one curve for the whole project

### Component composition

Define scales for the building blocks so components compose consistently:

**Spacing scale** (padding/gap inside components):
```
compact:  px-2 py-1   (8px / 4px)   — tags, badges, dense tables
default:  px-4 py-2   (16px / 8px)  — buttons, inputs, cards
spacious: px-6 py-3   (24px / 12px) — hero sections, feature cards
```

**Border radius scale:**
```
none: 0        — tables, full-bleed sections
sm:   4px      — inputs, small buttons
md:   8px      — cards, modals, standard buttons
lg:   12-16px  — feature cards, large containers
full: 9999px   — pills, avatars, toggle tracks
```

**Shadow scale** (elevation tiers):
```
sm:  0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)                         — subtle lift
md:  0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)                    — cards, dropdowns
lg:  0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)                  — modals, popovers
xl:  0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)                   — large modals, hero elements
```

In Tailwind, extend these in `tailwind.config`. In vanilla CSS, define as
custom properties. Shadows need adaptation for dark mode (reduce opacity,
increase blur).

### Match complexity to vision

Maximalist designs need elaborate code: extensive animations, layered
textures, complex compositions. Minimalist designs need restraint and
precision: careful spacing, typography refinement, subtle details. The
implementation must match the aesthetic — don't write minimal code for a
maximalist vision or bloated code for a minimal one.

---

## Phase 4: Verification

Run the `references/frontend-design-checklist.md` checklist. The key
domains:

**Accessibility:**
- Color contrast passes WCAG AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text)
- Semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, buttons not divs)
- Keyboard navigable with visible focus styles
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

**Responsive:**
- Works at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (desktop)
- No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint
- Touch targets at least 44x44px on mobile
- Typography scales (not just shrinks)

**Performance:**
- Fonts loaded with `font-display: swap` or `optional`
- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-composited)
- No excessive DOM depth from decorative wrappers

**Coherence:**
- All colors from defined tokens (no raw hex in components)
- Spacing follows a consistent scale
- Typography uses defined type scale
- Animation timing/easing consistent across elements

### Verification commands

Run the project's own commands first (check `package.json`, `Makefile`,
`CLAUDE.md`). Supplement with:

- **Type check**: `tsc --noEmit` (or project equivalent)
- **Lint**: `eslint`, `biome`, or project linter
- **Accessibility audit**: browser DevTools Accessibility panel, or
  `axe-core` / `@axe-core/cli` if installed
- **Contrast check**: verify specific color pairs meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 body,
  3:1 large text) using browser DevTools or a contrast ratio tool
- **Responsive check**: browser DevTools responsive mode at 375px, 768px,
  1280px

### Failure paths

- If contrast checks fail after implementation, adjust the failing colors
  to meet WCAG AA while staying within the chosen palette's hue — do not
  switch to a completely different palette.
- If the overall result feels generic despite the creative seed, revisit
  the seed and the concrete choices before shipping. The seed should be
  visibly present in the final result.
- If a font fails to load or renders poorly, swap to the next alternative
  from the same category and update the fallback stack.
