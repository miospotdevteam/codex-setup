name: look-before-you-leap
description: "Unified engineering discipline for ALL coding tasks. Three layers: this file (the conductor), quick-reference checklists, and deep guides. Enforces structured exploration before planning, persistent plans that survive compaction, disciplined execution with blast radius tracking and type safety, and multi-discipline coverage (testing, UI consistency, security, git, linting, dependencies). Use for every task that touches source files — no exceptions, no shortcuts."
---

# Software Discipline

This skill is the conductor. It controls the process and routes to deeper
guidance. The actual rules live in two companion skills that are always
injected alongside this one:

- **engineering-discipline** — The behavioral layer: explore before editing,
  track blast radius, no type shortcuts, verify work, no silent scope cuts.
- **persistent-plans** — The structural layer: plan files on disk, the
  execution loop, checkpoints, sub-plans, compaction survival.

**You must follow both companion skills for every coding task.**

---

## Step 0: Discover Available Skills

At the start of every session, note which skills are available (the
SessionStart hook provides a skill inventory). When a step calls for
specialized knowledge (testing, frontend design, security review), check
if an installed skill covers it before relying on general knowledge.

### External skill routing

Look for installed skills that match these needs:

| When you need... | Look for skills about... |
|---|---|
| Brainstorming, creative work | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:brainstorming` — never another plugin's brainstorming skill |
| Writing implementation plans | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:writing-plans` — never another plugin's writing-plans skill |
| Test strategy, TDD | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:test-driven-development` — never another plugin's TDD skill |
| Frontend UI work | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:frontend-design` — never another plugin's frontend-design skill |
| Security review | "security", "authentication", "auth" |
| Code review | "code review", "review" |
| Debugging | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:systematic-debugging` — never another plugin's debugging skill |
| Refactoring, restructuring, extracting, moving files | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:refactoring` (full mode) — never another plugin's refactoring skill |
| Post-execution simplification | **Always** use `look-before-you-leap:refactoring` (quick mode) — never another plugin's code-simplifier skill |
| PR/commit workflow | "commit", "PR", "git" |

If no specialized skill exists, use the checklists and guides in `references/`.

### First-run onboarding

When look-before-you-leap runs in a project for the first time, the
SessionStart hook auto-detects the stack and creates
`.claude/look-before-you-leap.local.md`. On that first session, additional
onboarding instructions are injected into the context telling you to:

1. Tell the user what was detected
2. Offer to enrich the config by exploring the codebase
3. Offer to create a CLAUDE.md if the project has none
4. Suggest useful official plugins and offer to install them

Follow those instructions when they appear. On subsequent sessions (config
already exists), no onboarding is injected — proceed normally.

---

## Step 1: Explore (mandatory before any edit)

Shallow exploration is the #1 cause of failed plans — every minute exploring
saves five minutes fixing.

Follow **engineering-discipline Phase 1** (Orient Before You Touch Anything).

Additionally, read `references/exploration-protocol.md` and answer all 8
questions. Exit criterion: confidence is Medium or higher. If Low, keep
exploring.

### Minimum exploration actions

1. Read the files you plan to modify AND their imports
2. Find consumers of any file you'll change — if dep maps are configured
   (check project profile for the full command with resolved paths),
   run `deps-query.py` for instant results; otherwise `Grep` for
   import statements
3. Read 2-3 sibling files to learn patterns
4. Check CLAUDE.md/README for project conventions
5. Search for existing solutions before implementing from scratch

For complex or unfamiliar codebases, also read
`references/exploration-guide.md`.

### Persist your findings

If the task requires exploration (anything beyond a trivial single-file
fix), create the plan directory and write findings to disk **before**
moving to Step 2:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-before-you-leap/scripts/init-plan-dir.sh
mkdir -p .temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>
```

Write a `discovery.md` in that directory with what you found: file paths,
patterns, conventions, dependencies, blast radius, open questions. Use
the 8 questions from `references/exploration-protocol.md` as structure.

This file survives compaction and feeds directly into the masterPlan's
Discovery Summary. If you skip this, your future compacted self starts
from zero.

---

## Step 2: Plan (write to disk before editing code)

**Invoke `look-before-you-leap:writing-plans`** to produce the masterPlan.
The skill consumes your discovery.md, identifies applicable discipline
checklists, structures TDD-granularity steps, and writes the masterPlan
to `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/masterPlan.md`.

Follow **persistent-plans Phase 1** (Create the Plan) for the structural
rules — the writing-plans skill handles the content.

Initialize the plan directory if needed:
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/look-before-you-leap/scripts/init-plan-dir.sh
```

Exception: the user explicitly says "just do it" or "no plan" for a trivially
obvious single-line change.

---

## Step 3: Execute (the loop)

**CRITICAL: Update your masterPlan.md after every 2-3 code file edits.**
Check off Progress items, add Result notes. A hook will remind you if you
forget, but don't rely on it — make it automatic. If compaction fires and
your plan is stale, all your work context is lost.

Follow **persistent-plans Phase 2** (Execute the Plan) for the execution
loop, checkpointing, and result tracking.

Follow **engineering-discipline Phase 2** (Make Changes Carefully) for the
rules applied during execution.

### Dispatching sub-agents

When a step benefits from parallel work (audits, multi-area exploration,
independent file groups), choose the right dispatch mode:

**Foreground parallel** (default):
Use when results inform your next steps or have cross-cutting concerns.
All agents run in parallel, you see all results before proceeding. Use
for: audits, exploration, reviews, any task where one finding might
affect another agent's scope.

**Background** (fire-and-forget only):
Use only when you have genuinely independent work to continue in the
main thread. You must poll with `TaskOutput` later — no automatic
cross-pollination. Use for: running builds/tests while continuing edits.

**Rule of thumb**: if you'd want to read Agent A's results before acting
on Agent B's results, use foreground. Background agents are isolated by
default.

### Shared discovery (cross-agent communication)

For parallel tasks where agents benefit from seeing each other's findings
(audits, multi-area exploration, large codebase research), agents share a
single discovery file:

**Location**: `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/discovery.md`

This file is created during Step 1 (Explore) when the plan directory is
set up. The `inject-subagent-context` hook automatically tells sub-agents
where it is and registers their dispatch.

**Writing** — use Bash append (`>>`), never `Edit`. Multiple agents write
concurrently, and append is atomic at the OS level:
```bash
printf '\n## [your-focus-area]\n- **[severity]** `file:line` — finding (evidence: ...)\n' >> discovery.md
```

**Reading** — read the file periodically to see other agents' findings,
but treat them as **informational context only**:
- Other findings may be wrong, incomplete, or irrelevant to your scope
- Do NOT change your investigation direction based on them
- Only note a cross-reference if you independently confirm a connection

After all agents complete, read the consolidated `discovery.md` to
synthesize results.

### Post-step simplification

When a completed step has `Simplify: true` in the plan, dispatch a
refactoring sub-agent (quick mode) after marking the step `[x]`:

1. **Run tests first** — establish a passing baseline before dispatch
2. **Dispatch** the `refactoring` sub-agent in quick mode (foreground) with:
   - The step number and its "Files involved" list
   - The active plan path
3. **After the agent returns**, record its simplification summary in the
   step's Result field
4. If the agent reverted changes due to test failures, note that too

The simplifier is opt-in per step. The `writing-plans` skill decides which
steps warrant it based on complexity (3+ files modified, new abstractions,
structural changes, or user request). Do not dispatch it for steps without
`Simplify: true`.

---

## Step 4: Verify (every time, no exceptions)

Follow **engineering-discipline Phase 3** (Verify Before Declaring Done).

See `references/verification-commands.md` for framework-specific commands.
Always check the project's own scripts first (package.json, Makefile).

Before declaring done, re-read the user's original request word by word.
Confirm every requirement is implemented and working. If anything is
unaddressed, finish it or explicitly flag it.

---

## Compaction Survival Protocol

Follow **persistent-plans Phase 3** (Resumption After Compaction).

Helper scripts:
```bash
bash .temp/plan-mode/scripts/plan-status.sh    # see all plan states
bash .temp/plan-mode/scripts/resume.sh         # find what to pick up
```

---

## Enforcement Hooks

This plugin enforces discipline through hooks, not just instructions:

- **PreToolUse(Edit|Write)**: Blocks code edits if no active plan exists
  in `.temp/plan-mode/active/`. Allows edits to `.temp/` (plan files).
  Bypass for trivial changes: `echo $PPID > .temp/plan-mode/.no-plan` (session-scoped, auto-expires when session ends).
- **PreToolUse(Bash)**: Blocks Bash commands that write files (redirects,
  sed -i, tee, etc.) when no active plan exists. Prevents using Bash to
  bypass the Edit/Write enforcement. Allows git, package managers, build
  tools, and writes to `.temp/`. Also blocks `mv` of plan directories
  from `active/` to `completed/` if the plan has unchecked items.
- **PostToolUse(Edit|Write)**: Counts code file edits. After 3 edits
  without updating masterPlan.md, injects a checkpoint reminder. Resets
  when any plan file is edited.
- **PreToolUse(Task)**: Automatically injects engineering discipline into
  every sub-agent prompt. Sub-agents receive the core rules (no scope cuts,
  no type shortcuts, blast radius, verification) plus active plan path.
- **Stop**: Blocks Claude from stopping if the active plan has unchecked
  items. Forces explicit completion, status update, or user communication.

**NEVER bypass hooks.** If a hook blocks an action, follow the process it
describes. Do not use alternative tools to work around it. Do not call it
a "false positive." The hooks exist to enforce the discipline that makes
your work survive compaction and remain correct.
